Manage User Subscription
========
This wordpress plugin adds a new table when you activate it, that contains the current user's start and end subscription dates. You can edit this dates as an admin, and also send them an email regarding the updates (a copy is sent to the admin too). The table is not deleted on plugin deactivation/removal.
Note: the plugin does just what it says above, and it's up to you to use the data added to show/hide content from the user in the theme.

### Nice to have (I'm not sure the plugin will be updated):
* Log every change
* Add jQuery UI Datepicker (now it's just input[type="date"])
